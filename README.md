%passing through "high cost" areas such as lakes or mountains and penalize
%accordingly The function will determine if it
%is cheaper to go 'around' the polygon or through it using a shortest path
%algorithm when it is determined to be necessary via linear correlation.
%the function inputs are node indices corresponding to connection, node
%location in LONGITUDE then LATITUDE (CORRESPONDING TO X AND Y), polycost which is a linear coefficient
%describing the 'cost' of going through a polygon, and resolution creates a
%resolution-by-resolution mesh when the shortest path algorithm is called
